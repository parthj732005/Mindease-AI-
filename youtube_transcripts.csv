d4U4ZdRrfHw,What happens at the moment of death? | Death as per Yogic Science | Heartfulness Meditation | Daaji,"0:02
[Music]
0:12
and we all fascinated by this question
0:16
what happens after that what becomes of
0:21
me
0:24
don't you ponder also what was i before
0:28
I was born so somewhere I must have died
0:32
in the past so when I die now I'll
0:35
become someone something and this alkyl
0:39
goes on and on and on unless of course
0:43
this new mechanism which Yogi's ever
0:46
invented from the experiences they have
0:51
claimed that there is a state let us
0:55
offer liberation or a moksha and what
0:59
happens to individual soul that is
1:04
liberated does it mean he will not be
1:07
incarnated again not really true
1:11
liberation is where you have total
1:13
freedom absolute freedom of being born
1:16
again or not
1:17
you may choose to be born you may chose
1:20
not to be born again
1:21
[Music]
1:25
time is a big thing you know it a lot
1:29
Esther says Carlos me meaning I am time
1:36
time creates and time alone kills this
1:41
is the inevitable law of time what
1:46
happens at the moment of that it's worth
1:49
exploring when that is about to come
1:55
first of all the element of Earth is
1:59
withdrawn from the basic plexus we call
2:04
this process as mooladhara chakra and
2:08
when this once this earth element is
2:11
withdrawn from mooladhara chakra it
2:14
moves up to swadisthana chakra
2:18
hypogastric plexus this is the place of
2:23
water element the earth element is then
2:27
converted into water hands and feet they
2:33
become cold
2:34
I want you felt this when someone is
2:37
dying you'll notice that hands and feet
2:40
will but suddenly become cold
2:42
this is the dissolution of water then
2:46
when water is withdrawn from the
2:50
hypogastric plexus or swadisthana chakra
2:52
and it's accumulated here and the solar
2:56
plexus in the region of our navel or
2:59
nabhi chakra it then becomes fire the
3:08
region about the navel of all it will
3:11
become warmer this is the dissolution of
3:15
fire then the fire is gradually
3:19
withdrawn and moves upward to cardiac
3:21
plexus unhappy or read a chakra when it
3:26
meets with earth mixes with air of the
3:30
heart region and the whole body will
3:33
begin to tremble
3:36
this is the dissolution of the air
3:39
element after that the air of the
3:42
cardiac plexus is withdrawn to the ether
3:45
element of anything it somehow
3:50
resolves the element which is present at
3:53
cantata cow or pharyngeal plexus there a
3:57
sound is produced at this vishuddhi
4:01
chakra
4:02
[Music]
4:04
with this sound well the sound is
4:06
produced what happens the soul takes an
4:10
exit either through the eyes or through
4:15
the ears or come out and the eyes are
4:19
turned backward now the element Abram
4:25
which is found an individual soul is
4:28
also withdrawn this is at this point
4:31
precisely the eyes that turned back and
4:34
now the worlds in the without element if
4:39
the soul is liberated then mixing with
4:44
the heart element becomes possible after
4:48
exiting from brahmarandhra which is from
4:51
the back well generally you know you
4:53
must have seen elderly people of bygone
4:56
days to keep so tea ponytail in the back
5:02
exactly there the number advice
5:04
liberated Souls they exit from this
5:06
particular point
5:08
unfortunately tradition holds on to this
5:13
idea so strongly that even after that
5:16
even when the body is totally burnt and
5:20
some parts of skull remains they will
5:22
smash it and this message in such a way
5:26
that the soul gets to live from this
5:31
twelfth of the number and that's a crock
5:35
but this is inhuman this is violent the
5:38
liberated soul doesn't need to blow up
5:41
from heavy instruments it just
5:45
evaporates it just transcends
5:47
automatically at that very moment of
5:50
death and mixes or bulges with Iraq
5:53
without element so this is in brief what
5:59
really happens at the moment of death
6:00
and depending upon the viability level
6:04
apartment
6:05
if it is a trick there to the whole
6:09
spectrum of subject for the thumbs ik
6:13
there is a spectrum of thumb Sigma and
6:16
if it is Isaac there is also a spectrum
6:19
to what extent is it thumb Sakura God's
6:22
a course at work and combination of it
6:25
all infinite possibilities and
6:28
accordingly there are infinite
6:30
dimensions so based on the vibratory
6:33
level of the soul it will reach out to
6:37
that dimension which is compatible to
6:40
that regulation nowhere else will it go
6:45
the whole process is reversed when we
6:50
incarnate next topic we will talk about
6:54
the Incarnation how we are conceived and
6:57
how soul comes into picture thank you
7:01
for listening on that
7:02
[Music]
7:18
you"
